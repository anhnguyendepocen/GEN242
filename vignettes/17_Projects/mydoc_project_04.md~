last_updated: 29-Apr-16

## RNA-Seq Workflow  

1. Read quality assessment, filtering and trimming 
2. Map reads against reference genome 
3. Perform read counting for required ranges (_e.g._ exonic gene ranges)
4. Normalization of read counts
5. Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
6. Clustering of gene expression profiles 
7. Gene set enrichment analysis

## Challenge Project: Comparison of DEG analysis methods

+ Run workflow from start to finish (steps 1-7) on RNA-Seq data set from Howard et al. (2013)
+ Challenge project tasks
    + Run at least 2 RNA-Seq DEG analysis methods (e.g. edgeR and DESeq2) and compare the results as follows:
        + Analyze the similarities and differences in the DEG lists obtained from the two methods
        + Does it affect the results from the downstream gene set enrichment analysis?
        + Plot the performance of the DEG methods in form of an ROC curve. The DEG set from the Howard et al., 2013 paper could be used as benchmark (true result).
