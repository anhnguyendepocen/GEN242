## VAR-Seq Workflow  

+ Read preprocessing
    + Quality filtering (trimming)
    + FASTQ quality report
+ Alignments
+ Alignment statistics
+ Variant calling
+ Variant filtering
+ Variant annotation
+ Combine results from many samples
+ Summary statistics of samples

## Challenge Project: Comparison of functional prediction methods of variants

+ Run workflow from start to finish (steps 1-8) on data set from Lu et al (2012)
+ Challenge project tasks
    + Compare the performance of the 3 functional prediction tools from Shihab et al. (2015), Kumar et al. (2009) and Adzhubei et al. (2013) for at least 10 of the highest ranking non-synonymous variants identified. Consider in your comparisons the following analysis/visualization steps:
        + Report unique and common functional variants identified by the three functional prediction tools.
        + Plot the results as venn diagrams or similar
        + Plot the performance of the three methods in form of ROC plots. As true result set one can use the union of the functional variants identified by all three methods. 
        + Optional: add any additional annotations such as proximity of functional variants to Pfam domains or Prosite motifs.
