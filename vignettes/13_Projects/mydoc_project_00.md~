During the tutorial sessions all students will perform the basic analysis of three 
NGS Workflow Projects including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and VAR-Seq. In addition, every student 
will work in a group of 3-5 students on a Challenge Project that addresses a specific data 
analysis problem within one of the three Workflow Projects. Students will also present a 
scientific paper closely related to their challenge topic. 

The challenge projects will be presented by each student group during last week of the 
course. In addition, each student write a detailed analysis report of their course project.
This report needs to include all analysis steps of the corresponding Workflow (_e.g._ full 
RNA-Seq analysis). The final project resports need to be written in R markdown. Both the R 
markdown script along with the rendered HTML (or PDF) report will be submitted to the 
instructor at the end of the quarter by or before June 8.
