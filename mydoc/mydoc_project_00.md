## Introduction

During the tutorial sessions of this class all students will perform the basic
data analysis of three NGS Workflows including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and VAR-Seq.
In addition, every student will work in a group of 3-5 students on a Challenge
Project addressing a specific data analysis task within one of the three NGS
Workflows. Students will also present a scientific paper closely related to
their challenge topic (see
[here](http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/mydoc/mydoc_paper_presentations.html)).
To facilitate teamwork among group members, each course project will be
assigned a private GitHub repository (see
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Im2mwX8NJ9FSZB2CVxoevTxttr2wzoG9ybL_GMMNN4A/edit#gid=1818533395)).

The results of the Challenge Projects will be presented by each student group
during the last week of the course (see Slideshow Template
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VJzj9L75HdGel-mnAbNLYc9Wmdxg3aQP8YmrWG3AsTU/edit)).
In addition, each student will write a detailed analysis report of the assigned
course project. This report needs to include all analysis steps of the
corresponding NGS Workflow (_e.g._ full RNA-Seq analysis) as well as the
code and results of the Challenge Project. The final project reports should be written
in R markdown. Both the R markdown script (.Rmd) along with the rendered HTML (or PDF)
report will be submitted to each student's private GitHub repository by or
before June 8.
