Data Analysis in Genome Biology <br>
GEN242 - Spring 2016

## Instructor
Name: Thomas Girke <br> 
Email: thomas.girke@ucr.edu <br>
Office location: 1207F Genomics <br>
Office hours: Tue & Thu 4:30 - 5:30 PM 


## Description

Introduction to algorithms, statistical methods and data analysis programming
routines relevant for genome biology. The class consists of three
main components: lectures, hands-on practicals and student course projects. The
lecture topics cover databases, sequence (NGS) analysis, phylogenetics,
comparative genomics, genome-wide profiling methods, network biology and more.
The hands-on practicals include homework assignments and course projects
focusing on data analysis programming of next generation genome data using
command-line tools on a computer cluster and the programming environment R.
Credit: 4 units (4 hours lecture, 2 hours discussion)

## Objectives of course

- Acquire understanding of algorithms used in bioinformatics
- Obtain hands-on experience in large scale data analysis.

## Prerequisites
The main prerequisite for this course is a strong interest in acquiring the
skills required for mastering the computational aspects of modern genome
research.

## Structure of course
Two lectures per week (2 hours each) plus one discussion section (1 hour).
During the first weeks the discussion section will be used for data analysis
tutorials using Linux command-line tools and R. 

## Time
Lecture: Tue/Thu 2:10-3:30 PM <br>
Discussion: Thu 3:40-4:30 PM

## Location
[2130 CHASS Interdisciplinary Bldg-South (INST)](http://classrooms.cmsdev.ucr.edu/buildings/chassINTS/2130.html)

## Grading
1. Homework assignments: 40%
2. Scientific paper presentation: 20%
3. Course project presentations: 20%
4. Final project report: 20%

## Materials needed
Students are expected to bring to each class meeting a laptop with a functional wireless
connection and a recent internet browser version (e.g. Firefox, Chrome or
Safari) preinstalled. Tablet computers with mobile operating systems are not
suitable for running the required software. User accounts on a research
computer cluster will be provided at the beginning of the course. To log in to
the cluster, students also need to install a terminal application for their
operating system (_e.g._ [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) on OS X
or [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) on
Windows) as well as a file exchange software such as
[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client). In
addition, a recent version of [R](http://www.r-project.org) and
[RStudio](http://rstudio.org) should be installed on each laptop.
